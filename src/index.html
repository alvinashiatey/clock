              The present reigned supreme <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like the shallow floods
              over the gutters<br />

              Too strange the sudden change<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the times we buried

              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The memories that we

              Our sapless roots have fed<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind-swept seedlings
              of another age. <br />Luxuriant weeds have grown where we led<br />
              The Virgins to the water’s edge.<br />
              There at the edge of the town<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just by the burial
              ground<br />
              Stands the house without a shadow<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lived in by new
              skeletons. That is all that is left <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To greet us on the
              home-coming <br />
              After we have paced the world <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And longed for
              returning.
